## Roadmap:
This exercise is for educational purposes only.  I would like to add a finished/done button that the player clicks to indicate the end of their turn. each Square component that  checks that the player has clicked the finished button and doesn't let the player click again and change their selection. I would also liked to create a feature that allows the player to choose the color their square will change to when clicked.
