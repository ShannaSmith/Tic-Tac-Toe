TicTacToe game created with React
## How To Play:
Choose if you will be X or O. Be the first to get your letter placed in a row of three either horizontially, vertically, or diagoinally on the game board while blocking your opponent from doing so, to win.

## Installation:
`git clone` repository and run 'create-react app server' in your terminal. This file requires node.js to operate.

## Future Goals:
I would like to add a finished/done button that the player clicks to indicate the end of their turn. Each Square component checks that the player has clicked the finished button and doesn't let the player click again to change their selection. I would also liked to create a feature that allows the player to choose the color their square will change to when clicked.
